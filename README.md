### Objectives
Combine multiple real-world imbalanced classification tasks. Develop robust pipelines to
handle skewed data, create explainable and reproducible models, and compare performance
across different algorithms and data-balancing strategies.
<br>
### Detailed Tasks
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
2. **Dealing with Imbalance**: Compare oversampling (SMOTE/ADASYN), undersampling, and class-weighting approaches.
3. **Model Building**: Implement various classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random
Forest, XGBoost).
4. **Explainable AI**: Generate SHAP or LIME plots to interpret model outputs and
feature contributions.
5. **Evaluation & Visualization**:Use ROC and Precision-Recall curves, confusion matrices, and tabular comparisons to measure performance.
