# Mini Project
This mini project was conducted under the guidance of Jyoti Prakash Mishra sir at kiit university during 6th semester from Jan 2025 to Mar 2025

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to combine multiple real-world imbalanced classification tasks. We aim to develop robust pipelines to handle skewed data, create explainable and reproducible models, and compare performance across different algorithms and data-balancing strategies.

## Detailed Tasks
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
2. **Handling Imbalance**: Compare oversampling techniques (SMOTE/ADASYN), undersampling, and class-weighting approaches.
3. **Model Building**: Implement various classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. **Explainable AI**: Generate SHAP or LIME plots to interpret model outputs and feature contributions.
5. **Evaluation & Visualization**: Use ROC and Precision-Recall curves, confusion matrices, and tabular comparisons to measure performance.

## Datasets
We have selected multiple datasets to explore different real-world imbalanced classification problems:

### 1. **Telco Customer Churn**
- **[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)**
- **Objective**: Predict which customers are likely to stop using the service.

### 2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
- **[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)**
- **Objective**: Identify fraudulent credit card transactions (highly imbalanced dataset).

### 3. **Employee Attrition (IBM HR Analytics)**
- **[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)**
- **Objective**: Predict which employees are most likely to leave the company.

### 4. **Loan Approval Prediction**
- **[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)**
- **Objective**: Forecast whether a loan application will be approved.

This project leverages real-world datasets to develop machine learning models that effectively handle class imbalance while ensuring interpretability and robust performance evaluation.
