### Objectives
Combine multiple real-world imbalanced classification tasks. Develop robust pipelines to
handle skewed data, create explainable and reproducible models, and compare performance
across different algorithms and data-balancing strategies.
<br>
### Detailed Tasks
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
2. **Dealing with Imbalance**: Compare oversampling (SMOTE/ADASYN), undersampling, and class-weighting approaches.
3. **Model Building**: Implement various classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random
Forest, XGBoost).
4. **Explainable AI**: Generate SHAP or LIME plots to interpret model outputs and
feature contributions.
5. **Evaluation & Visualization**:Use ROC and Precision-Recall curves, confusion matrices, and tabular comparisons to measure performance.
### Datasets
1. **Telco Customer Churn**
   - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
   - **Goal**: Predict which customers are likely to stop using the service

2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
   - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
   - **Goal**: Identify fraudulent credit card transactions (highly imbalanced).

3. **Employee Attrition (IBM HR Analytics)**
   - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
   - **Goal**: Predict which employees are most likely to leave the company.

4. **Loan Approval Prediction**
   - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)
   - **Goal**:  Forecast whether a loan application will be approved.
